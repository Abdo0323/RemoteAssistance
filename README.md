### Starting the Server
Execute the `Main` class in the server-side code to launch the `NetworkScreenServer`.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new NetworkScreenServer();
    }
}
```

### Connecting to the Server

2. Enter the server's IP address in the provided text field.
3. Click the "Connect" button.

### Exiting the Server or Client
Click the "Exit" button on the server or client to close the respective application.
